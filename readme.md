# Final Project 

## Project description
For my Final Project, I created an online store focused on activewear from Lululemon. The website allows users to browse and display activewear, with features like sorting products by categories and color selection for each item. I also focused on the UI experience, ensuring smooth and intuitive interactions, including hover effects etc. 

Users can easily add items to their cart, and the site allows for a clean and organized overview of the cart with a clear option to view or modify the items. Although the "Become a Member" functionality is included, the main focus was on the seamless browsing experience. 

## Project Installation 
To install the project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/ceciliamanner/final_project.git
Navigate into into the project directory:

cd final_project
Open the index.html file in your preffered web browser to get started.

No dependencies or build tools are required for this project, as it is simple front-end application. 


## Usage
To use the final project:
Open the index.html file in a browser.

Fill in your email address and create a password to join the Lululemon community. Upon registration, youâ€™ll be greeted with welcome message, unlocking the shopping experience.

Access the product overview page to browse the collection of activewear. Products can be sorted by category (Accessories, Outerwear, Sweaters, Dresses) or by price. Each product offers two color options to choose from, select your products and add them to your cart using the "Add to Cart" button.

**Cart Functionality:**

The cart displays all selected items, along with options to adjust quantities or remove products entirely.
A running total is calculated, providing a clear overview of your purchase before checkout.

Once the checkout is complete, all cart data will be cleared from localStorage, ensuring a clean slate for the next session.

Key sections like "Become a Member" and "Your Cart" are always accessible via the header for a smooth user experience.
